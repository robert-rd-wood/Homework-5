# Matplotlib Practice

### Pyber  

Analysis performed on a sample ride-sharing data set using Python and pandas, and visualizations created using matplotlib.  


Bubble Plot showing the relationship between four key variables:  
  * Average Fare ($) Per City  
  * Total Number of Rides Per City  
  * Total Number of Drivers Per City  
  * City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
